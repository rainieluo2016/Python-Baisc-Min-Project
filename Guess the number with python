# Rules:
# You can key in n as the range and python will randomly pick a integer (0,n) as its answer
# Feature:
# 1. Python will remind you whehter you guess is too big or too small
# 2. if you accidentally key in a non-int, you will be reminded this is not a integer
# 3. if you want to quit in between, there is instruction that you can leave as long as enter a number larger than range
# 4. if you key in a number that has already been guessed, you will be reminded you and ask you to guess again
# 5. At the end, there is a guess count to show how many times you try
